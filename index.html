	<h3> Work Expirience </h3>

	<p> With my age being a big restriction on how much work expirience I can get that never stoped me from my own buisness ventures. I started off my carrer at around age 7 where I would setup lemonade stands with a buisness partner that would cotrol suply while I was in the front end gitting it sold with many persuasive tactics (DSD Lemonade‚Ñ¢). This venture eventually died out as I got older even if I was cauculating the times we had the most traffic and where the most people came through but that didnt stop me to manage two of these stands while taking home most of the profit. The next venture was in middle school where I had plans for a lottery service where I would be colleting money for a chance to win more money back (dotfordot‚Ñ¢), this failed due to one main reason, the law and how I cant get middle schoolers adicted to gambiling. I went along with my mom for a few years to private parties to do catering where I met many famous and influential people. The next serious Buisness came along two years ago (Homesellingphotos‚Ñ¢), this is the first legally registered buisness I ever owend and as the name suggests it was a realestate photography buissnes. This led me to great places with me being able to even buy brand new gear which are assetes to this company that I still own and use to this day. The next objective of mine was to get a job, I got a job at (Kings‚Ñ¢) where I was working at the front end. Unfortionatly I had to quit due to my internship at CRI partners‚Ñ¢ in Belgium which is a multi-million dollar firm that specializes in construction. I plan to keep going this way with the next venture beating the previous one.</p>
